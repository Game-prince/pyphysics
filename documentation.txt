# Essentials for making a physics library
There are three main aspects of the physics library.
Dynamics, Collision Detection and Collision Response.

1. Dynamics:
    All the displacements, velocities, accelrations and forces comes under this section.
    Applying gravity or anti-gravity also comes under this section.
    For implenting these properties we need understanding of dynamic physics.
    
    # Some important equations for the movement and velocity calculations
        1. v = u + at 
        2. s = ut + 1/2at^2
        3. v^2 - u^2 = 2as
        where v = final velocity
              u = initial velocity
              a = accelration
              s = distance
    
    For force and momentum calculation Newton's law are very useful
    # Newton's laws of motions -
        Newton's 1st law - An object will not change its state of rest or motion or change its direction until an external force is applied on it.
        Newtons' 2nd law - The force applied in a body is equal to the change in momemtum in it.
        Newton's 3rd law - Every force has equal and opposite reaction on it.

    # Different entities in the universe
    1. space (dimension, caption)
        It is an empty place where different objects will interact with each other.
        # properties
            Dimension - width , height
            Gravity - x-axis, y-axis
            Drag - air resistance
            Attraction - Will different elements will have gravity acting on them

    2. objects (dimension , position, space)
        These are the entities which are present in the space.
        # properties
            Mass - 
            Dimensions -
            Friction
            position
            velocity
            accelration
